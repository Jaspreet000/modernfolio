# Blockly - Block-Based Programming Environment

A modern, responsive web application that provides a visual programming environment using Blockly. This tool allows users to create programs by dragging and dropping blocks, making programming more accessible and intuitive.

## 🚀 Features

### Visual Programming Interface

- **Interactive Block Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for building programs
- **Multiple Block Categories**:
  - Variables: Create and manage variables
  - Math: Perform mathematical operations
  - Output: Display results and messages
  - Logic: Implement conditional logic and boolean operations

### Modern UI/UX

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Dual View System**:
  - Workspace view for block programming
  - Console view for output and execution results
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicators for execution status and errors

### Development Features

- **Live Code Generation**: Automatic JavaScript code generation from blocks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting
- **Block Validation**: Automatic validation of block connections and configurations

### Technical Highlights

- **Modern Stack**: Built with React and Blockly
